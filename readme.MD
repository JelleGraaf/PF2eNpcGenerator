# What's this?
This is an attempt to a text-based NPC generator for Pathfinder second edition.
It is presented as a christmas gift to Mark Otting, for being our trusty GM since the
beginning of time. Lately, he has been complaining that Pathfinder 2e doesn't have an 
NPC codex. This tries to solve at least part of that.

# How to use
Just run New-Npc.ps1. The rest of the files are loaded on-demand.
